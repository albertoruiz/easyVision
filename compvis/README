simple examples
---------------

- demo: several image processing filters and image properties which can be selected from a menu.

- record: plays a given image source, which can be optionally recorded in a file.

- warp: applies a synthetic rotation to the image source

- detect: motion detector

- static: detector of static frames

- interpolate: examples of camera combinators (image sequence processing using ordinary list functions)

- pseudocolor: computes simple color index from HSV

- fft: uses peak in fft to normalize orientation and scale of text

- matches: shows interest point correspondences

- dethessian: simple object recognition based on interest points

- contours: affine invariant silhouette recognition

- background: detection of something different from a background image

- zoom: demo of zoom window, useful to observe pixel values
